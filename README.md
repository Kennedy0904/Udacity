# Data Analyst Nanodegree

This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize data, uncover
patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. You’ll develop
proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a
portfolio of projects to showcase in your job search. You may find out more [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

## Project 1: Investigate a Dataset

In this project, you’ll choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.
You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your
findings.

## Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results

In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report.

## Project 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, you'll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. You'll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

## Project 4: Communicate Data Findings

In this project, you will use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, you will create a presentation that communicates
your findings to others.
