# Exploring Weather Trends

## Project Overview
In this project, i analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends for the closest city from where i live which is 'Kuala Lumpur' to overall global temperature trends. The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live.

## What do you need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Conclusion
Overall, the temperature in Kuala Lumpur is much higher than global. And I do some exta works on predict the Kuala Lumpur temperature in future using global temperature data.
