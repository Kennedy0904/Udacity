# Project 5 - Communicate Data Findings

## About the Project
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I have used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset ([Ford  GoBike]([https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data)) data), starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in the given dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings is through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

### Why this project?

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.  
**Exploratory**  data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that is used to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help me approach any statistical analyses and will help me build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.  
**Explanatory**  data visualization techniques are used after generating my findings, and are used to help communicate my results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that my message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

### What I learnt?

After completing this project, I am able to:

-   Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
-   Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing me to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
-   Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
